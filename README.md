I made this template for mid/large scale web apps. It's MIT Licensed, so you can use this template for both open source and commercial projects.

<hr>

This template includes:

* Modern approaches and technologies (Next.js, TypeScript, Yarn, Eslint, Storybook, Cypress, TailwindCSS, Redux Toolkit, Axios, React Icons, etc.)

* Fully maintainable and scalable component structure with best practices to improve performance (with better hydration)

* Global state management structure to handle dataflows with more systematic and efficient way

* Easily manageable and testable development system with Storybook & Cypress

(I added some example usage scenarios of these structures)

<hr>

```bash
yarn install

yarn dev

yarn build

yarn lint

yarn storybook

yarn cypress
```
